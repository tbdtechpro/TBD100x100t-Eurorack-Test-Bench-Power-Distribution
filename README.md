# TBD100x100t Eurorack Test Bench Power Distribution 
 Eurorack distribution board with banana jack sockets for inputs and test probe sockets and a terminal block at the end of the circuit.
 This is part of a series of 100mm x 100mm Power Distribution boards I'm putting together. There is also a default board and an extension board.
 The size was chosen to allow for cheap manufacture with the prototype PCB providers
 This circuit is using a Pi filter to remove ripple. I have not yet recieved my first prototypes so it is untested at this time. 
 TBD-100x100t is intended for test bench usage. 
 The test board only has five 16 pin headers since I personally haven't had the need for more than 3-4 modules when testing a new DIY module
 The diamond shaped pad patterns on the bottom right of the board should accept PCB mount sockets for full size banana jacks. This should allow easy connections with bench power supplies.
 The top-right of the board has space for multimeter probe sized test sockets and also accomodates a terminal block if you would like to attach to an extension board. 
 Parts and values are listed in the BOM. Mouser part numbers are included and I will update ASAP with Tayda equivalents
